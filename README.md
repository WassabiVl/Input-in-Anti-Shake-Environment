# Input-in-AntiShake-Enviroment
Thesis research: Input in an anti-shake environment will degrade its accuracy

A research app that focuses on user input in an anti-shake enviroment.
The anti-shake is implemented using the Gyroscope sensor of the android device.
The test is designed to test the increase in error rate by having two tests:
  Test 1 (main activity): the control activity with a fixed input
  Test 2 (Second activity): a full screen display stablizer (anti-shake)
